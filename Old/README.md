Hello there!!

Within you'll find my (currently, only xmonad) config files, running in Ubuntu
12.04.  I'll update a lot more later -- some of the really important stuff comes
into play with the dzen scripts.

Ten thousand thanks to /u/earsplit on reddit; I used a lot of his work in
modelling my own system.  Inspiration for the powerline status bar also came
from /u/phallus, though he was running AwesomeWM, if memory serves.

Enjoy the files~
